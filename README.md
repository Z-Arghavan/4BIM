# A short experiment on BIM education (unfinished project)

This is a short and experimental mini-game designed for (open)BIM education.  
Players must choose wisely between:
- IFC: Industry Foundation Classes
- BCF: BIM Collaboration Format
- IDS: Information Delivery Specification  


The idea was to create a role-playing and scenario-driven web game that replicates siyiations for  which different openBIM files, formats and servcies are used.
